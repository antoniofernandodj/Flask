This is a experiment to run flask with an architecture near to Django, where we find 3 majoy layers, so to speak.

1. The first layer with the responsability to register the urls and what names and they has and what functions they call;
2. the second layer with the responsability to define the design of the database and how to handle the sql tables;
3. The last layer responsible to handle each request and what data to send to the front end
